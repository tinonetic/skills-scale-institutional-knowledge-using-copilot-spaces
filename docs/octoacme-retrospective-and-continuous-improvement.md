# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective

### Preparation
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Review action items from previous retrospective first

### Retrospective Formats

**1. Start/Stop/Continue**
- **Start**: What should we begin doing?
- **Stop**: What should we stop doing?
- **Continue**: What's working well and should continue?

**2. 4 Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)**
- **Liked**: What did we enjoy or appreciate?
- **Learned**: What new insights did we gain?
- **Lacked**: What was missing or insufficient?
- **Longed For**: What do we wish we had?

**3. Sailboat Retrospective**
- **Wind** (helps us go faster): What's propelling us forward?
- **Anchor** (slows us down): What's holding us back?
- **Rocks** (risks ahead): What obstacles do we foresee?
- **Island** (goal): Where are we headed?

**4. Mad/Sad/Glad**
- **Mad**: What frustrated or angered us?
- **Sad**: What disappointed us?
- **Glad**: What made us happy or proud?

### Sample Retrospective Questions

**For Sprint/Iteration Retrospectives:**
- What helped us deliver value this sprint?
- What blockers or impediments did we face?
- How well did we collaborate as a team?
- Did we meet our sprint goal? Why or why not?
- What would we do differently next sprint?

**For Release Retrospectives:**
- Did we meet our release objectives and success metrics?
- How smooth was the deployment process?
- What surprised us during this release cycle?
- How effective was our communication with stakeholders?
- What technical debt did we accumulate?

**For Incident Retrospectives (Blameless):**
- What happened and when did we first notice?
- What was the impact on users and systems?
- What went well in our response?
- What could we improve in our detection, response, or prevention?
- What follow-up actions will prevent recurrence?

### Tips for Remote Retrospectives
- Use digital collaboration tools (Miro, Mural, FigJam, etc.)
- Enable video to maintain human connection
- Use breakout rooms for small group discussions
- Allow time for individual reflection before group sharing
- Use polls or voting features to prioritize topics
- Record retrospectives (with team consent) for those who can't attend

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner:
- Due date:
- Success criteria:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
