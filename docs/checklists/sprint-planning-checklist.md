## Sprint Planning Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- [ ] **Avoid:** Planning without a clear sprint goal
- [ ] **Avoid:** Overcommitting based on ideal capacity (account for interruptions)
- [ ] **Avoid:** Including stories without clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Avoid:** Skipping estimation or technical feasibility discussion
- [ ] **Avoid:** Ignoring dependencies or assuming they'll resolve themselves
- [ ] **Avoid:** Planning sessions that exceed 2 hours (for a 2-week sprint)

---

## Tips for Effective Sprint Planning

1. **Timeboxing**: Keep planning sessions to 1-2 hours max for a 2-week sprint
2. **Right Sizing**: If a story can't be completed in the sprint, break it down
3. **Buffer Time**: Reserve 10-20% capacity for unplanned work and bug fixes
4. **Collaborative Estimation**: Use team-based estimation (planning poker, etc.)
5. **Clear Exit Criteria**: Don't leave planning until the sprint goal and scope are crystal clear
6. **Update as You Go**: Sprint plans are living documents—adjust if priorities shift
