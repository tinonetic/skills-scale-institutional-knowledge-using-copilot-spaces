# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central documentation hub for OctoAcme's project management processes. This README is the main entry point for contributors and team members to quickly understand, find, and use our process guides.

Quick summary
- Customer-first and iterative delivery
- Clear ownership and role definitions (PM, PdM, Developers, QA)
- Work broken into shippable increments with defined acceptance criteria
- Regular cadence for planning, execution, demos, and retrospectives
- Continuous improvement driven by retrospectives and tracked action items
- Risks, dependencies and stakeholder communication are tracked and escalated explicitly
